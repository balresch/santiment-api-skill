# Santiment Metrics Catalog

For the full list of 750+ metrics, query `getAvailableMetrics`. Use this reference to translate user intent into search keywords, then scan the API's metric list for matches.

## Keyword Map for Metric Discovery

When the user describes data they want, map their intent to search keywords that appear in Santiment metric names. Search the `getAvailableMetrics` result for these keywords to find candidate metrics.

| On-chain activity | `active_addresses`, `transaction`, `network_growth` | `daily_active_addresses`, `transaction_volume` |
| Exchange flows | `exchange`, `inflow`, `outflow`, `balance` | `exchange_inflow`, `exchange_outflow`, `exchange_balance` |
| Holder / whale behavior | `holder`, `top`, `amount_in`, `supply`, `whale` | `amount_in_top_holders`, `holders_distribution_*` |
| MVRV / NVT / ratios | `mvrv`, `nvt`, `realized`, `ratio` | `mvrv_usd`, `mvrv_usd_intraday`, `nvt` |
| Social sentiment | `social`, `sentiment`, `dominance` | `social_volume_total`, `social_dominance_total` |
| Development | `dev_activity`, `contributors`, `github` | `dev_activity`, `dev_activity_contributors_count` |
| Supply distribution | `supply`, `percent`, `circulation`, `dormant` | `percent_of_total_supply_on_exchanges`, `circulation_*` |
| Token age / movement | `age`, `consumed`, `dormant`, `velocity` | `token_age_consumed`, `dormant_circulation_*`, `velocity` |
| Derivatives / funding | `funding`, `open_interest`, `liquidation` | `funding_rate`, `open_interest`, `total_liquidations_*` |

| Labeled flows | `labeled`, `label`, `dex`, `defi`, `cex` | `labeled_exchange_*`, `defi_*` |

## Curated Quick-Reference

Twenty commonly used metrics for the most frequent query types. Use these directly when they match the user's request — no discovery needed.

| Financial | `volume_usd` | Trading volume in USD |
| Financial | `marketcap_usd` | Market capitalization in USD |
| On-Chain | `daily_active_addresses` | Unique addresses active per day |
| On-Chain | `transaction_volume` | Total value transferred on-chain |
| On-Chain | `network_growth` | New addresses created per day |
| On-Chain | `velocity` | Transaction volume / token supply |
| On-Chain | `token_circulation` | Tokens that changed addresses |
| On-Chain | `token_age_consumed` | Destruction of token-days (signals long-held coins moving) |
| Exchange | `exchange_balance` | Total token balance held on known exchanges |
| Exchange | `exchange_inflow` | Tokens deposited to exchanges |
| Exchange | `exchange_outflow` | Tokens withdrawn from exchanges |
| Valuation | `mvrv_usd` | Market Value to Realized Value — signals over/undervaluation |
| Valuation | `nvt` | Network Value to Transactions ratio |
| Social | `social_volume_total` | Total mentions across social channels |
| Social | `social_dominance_total` | Relative share of social mentions vs all assets |
| Development | `dev_activity` | Development activity (filtered GitHub events) |
| Development | `dev_activity_contributors_count` | Number of active contributors |
| Supply | `amount_in_top_holders` | Amount held by top N holders (use `holdersCount` in selector) |
| Supply | `percent_of_total_supply_on_exchanges` | Share of supply sitting on exchanges |

## Naming Conventions

Metric names use `snake_case`. Prefixes indicate category (`exchange_`, `social_`, `dev_`, `holders_`). Suffixes indicate denomination or scope (`_usd`, `_btc`, `_total`). The `_intraday` suffix marks higher-frequency variants of daily metrics (e.g., `mvrv_usd_intraday`). Wildcard patterns like `holders_distribution_*` cover families of related sub-metrics with different selector parameters.

## Chain Coverage and Ghost Data

On-chain metrics are computed only for blockchains that Santiment indexes. When a token's primary chain is not indexed, on-chain queries return **empty timeseries `[]` without any error**. The agent may incorrectly conclude "no activity detected" — this is the "ghost data" problem.

### Which Metrics Are Chain-Dependent?

| Category | Chain-dependent? | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| On-chain activity | **YES** | `daily_active_addresses`, `transaction_volume`, `network_growth`, `velocity` |
| Exchange flows | **YES** | `exchange_inflow`, `exchange_outflow`, `exchange_balance` |
| Supply / holder metrics | **YES** | `amount_in_top_holders`, `holders_distribution_*`, `percent_of_total_supply_on_exchanges` |
| Token age / movement | **YES** | `token_age_consumed`, `dormant_circulation_*`, `token_circulation` |
| Valuation ratios | **YES** | `mvrv_usd`, `nvt` (derived from on-chain data) |
| Financial (price/volume) | **NO** | `price_usd`, `volume_usd`, `marketcap_usd` |
| Social | **NO** | `social_volume_total`, `social_dominance_total` |
| Development | **NO** | `dev_activity`, `dev_activity_contributors_count` |

Financial, social, and development metrics are aggregated from off-chain sources (exchanges, social platforms, GitHub) and work for any listed token regardless of blockchain.

### Reactive Diagnostic Flow

Run these checks **only when `timeseriesDataJson` returns `[]` without errors**. Do not run them preemptively on every query.

**Step 1 — Check data availability timestamps:**

```graphql
{
  getMetric(metric: "daily_active_addresses") {
    availableSince(slug: "trust-wallet-token")
    lastDatetimeComputedAt(slug: "trust-wallet-token")
  }
}
```

If `availableSince` returns `1970-01-01T00:00:00Z` (Unix epoch), the metric has **never been computed** for this slug. This confirms the empty result is not a temporary gap — the data does not exist.

**Step 2 — Identify the token's blockchain:**

```graphql
{
  projectBySlug(slug: "trust-wallet-token") {
    slug
    name
    ticker
    infrastructure
  }
}
```

The `infrastructure` field reveals the token's primary chain (e.g., `"BEP20"`, `"SOL"`, `"ETH"`). If the chain is not one Santiment indexes for on-chain data, that explains the empty result.

**Step 3 — Pivot to chain-agnostic metrics:**

Query financial, social, or development metrics instead — these work regardless of blockchain:

```graphql
{
  getMetric(metric: "price_usd") {
    availableSince(slug: "trust-wallet-token")
  }
}
```

A real date (not epoch) confirms this metric has data for the token.

### Decision Tree

```
timeseriesDataJson returns [] and no errors?
├─ YES → Check availableSince for this metric + slug
│   ├─ Returns epoch (1970-01-01) → Metric never computed for this slug
│   │   ├─ Check projectBySlug { infrastructure }
│   │   ├─ Report: "On-chain metric X is not available for [token] ([chain])"
│   │   └─ Offer chain-agnostic alternatives (price, social, dev metrics)
│   └─ Returns real date → Data gap; widen time range or check lastDatetimeComputedAt
└─ NO → Process data normally
```

### Communication Guidance

When an on-chain metric returns empty data due to chain coverage:

- **NEVER** say "no activity detected" or "zero on-chain activity" — this is factually wrong
- **DO** say: "[Metric] is not available for [token] because Santiment does not index on-chain data for [chain]. Here is what IS available: [price/social/dev data]."
- Always offer to query alternative metrics that do have data for the token
