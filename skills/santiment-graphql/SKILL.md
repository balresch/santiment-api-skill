# Santiment GraphQL API

Query the Santiment API — a GraphQL platform providing 750+ metrics for 2,000+ crypto assets across 12 blockchains. Fetch on-chain, financial, social, and development data for the cryptocurrency market.

## Endpoint and Authentication

- **GraphQL endpoint:** `https://api.santiment.net/graphql`
- **Interactive explorer:** `https://api.santiment.net/graphiql`

Every request requires an API key in the `Authorization` header (`Authorization: Apikey <KEY>`). The user must provide their own key — never hardcode or assume one. If `$SANTIMENT_API_KEY` is set in the environment, use it directly. Otherwise, ask the user for their key (free tier available at https://app.santiment.net/account#api-keys).

All requests are HTTP `POST` with `Content-Type: application/json`. **Use GraphQL variables** to separate the query template from runtime values — this avoids quote-escaping errors. In curl, use a heredoc with a quoted delimiter (`<< 'QUERY'`) so the shell doesn't interpret `$variable` as environment variables.

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://api.santiment.net/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Apikey $SANTIMENT_API_KEY" \
  -d @- << 'QUERY'
{
  "query": "query($metric: String!, $slug: String, $from: DateTime!, $to: DateTime!, $interval: interval) { getMetric(metric: $metric) { timeseriesData(slug: $slug, from: $from, to: $to, interval: $interval) { datetime value } } }",
  "variables": {
    "metric": "price_usd",
    "slug": "bitcoin",
    "from": "utc_now-7d",
    "to": "utc_now",
    "interval": "1d"
  }
}
QUERY
```

### Variable Types

Use these GraphQL types in `query(...)` variable declarations:

| Parameter | Type |
|---|---|
| `metric` | `String!` |
| `slug` | `String` |
| `selector` | `MetricTargetSelectorInputObject` |
| `from` / `to` | `DateTime!` |
| `interval` | `interval` |
| `aggregation` | `Aggregation` |
| `transform` | `TimeseriesMetricTransformInputObject` |

## Core Query: `getMetric`

Nearly all data flows through `getMetric`. Pass a metric name string and then select one sub-field that determines the shape of the response data.

### Sub-fields

Choose exactly one sub-field per `getMetric` call:

| Sub-field | Returns | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `timeseriesData` | `[{datetime, value}]` | Default choice — returns a time series with explicit field selection. Use for charting, trend analysis, or any case where individual data points matter. |
| `timeseriesDataJson` | Pre-formatted JSON string | Quick dump without specifying return fields. Useful for rapid prototyping but less control over output shape. |
| `timeseriesDataPerSlugJson` | JSON object keyed by slug | Fetch the same metric for multiple assets in a single API call. Pass `selector: { slugs: ["bitcoin", "ethereum"] }`. This counts as one API call, making it much more efficient than separate queries per asset. |
| `aggregatedTimeseriesData` | Single numeric value | Need one summary number (average, sum, last value) over a time range. Lowest complexity, most quota-friendly. |
| `histogramData` | Array of bucketed ranges | Distribution data — e.g., how much ETH was bought at each price range. Less commonly needed. |
| `metadata` | Metric metadata object | Discover available slugs, aggregations, selectors, intervals, and data type for a metric. Call this before querying an unfamiliar metric. |
| `availableSince` | ISO 8601 date string | Check how far back data exists for a given metric and slug. Prevents wasted calls on empty time ranges. |
| `lastDatetimeComputedAt` | ISO 8601 timestamp | Check data freshness — when the metric was last computed for a slug. |

### Parameters

These parameters are passed to the sub-field, not to `getMetric` itself:

| Parameter | Type | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `slug` | String | Asset identifier. Use for single-asset queries. | `"bitcoin"`, `"ethereum"` |
| `selector` | Object | Advanced selection. Use instead of `slug` when you need multi-asset queries, or filtering by `owner`, `label`, `holdersCount`, or `source`. | `{ slug: "bitcoin", source: "cryptocompare" }` |
| `from` | String | Start of time range. Accepts ISO 8601 timestamps or relative expressions. | `"2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"`, `"utc_now-30d"` |
| `to` | String | End of time range. Same format as `from`. | `"utc_now"` |
| `interval` | String | Time granularity between data points. | `"5m"`, `"1h"`, `"1d"`, `"7d"` |
| `aggregation` | Enum | Override the default aggregation method. Options: `AVG`, `SUM`, `LAST`, `FIRST`, `MEDIAN`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `ANY`. | `AVG` |
| `transform` | Object | Post-processing transform applied to the result. | See Transforms section. |

**Important:** `slug` and `selector` are mutually exclusive. Use `slug` for simple single-asset queries. Use `selector` when querying multiple slugs at once (`{ slugs: [...] }`) or when a metric requires additional selector fields like `holdersCount` or `owner`.

### Relative Time Expressions

The `from` and `to` fields accept relative expressions: `utc_now-<N><unit>` where unit is `d` (day), `w` (week), `m` (month), or `y` (year). Preferred over hardcoded dates.

- `"utc_now"` — current time
- `"utc_now-7d"` — 7 days ago
- `"utc_now-1m"` — 1 month ago
- `"utc_now-1y"` — 1 year ago

### Transforms

Apply transforms directly in the query to post-process data server-side. Pass the `transform` parameter to `timeseriesData`:

| Transform | Effect | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| `{type: "moving_average", movingAverageBase: N}` | Replace each value with the average of the preceding N values | Smooth noisy metrics like MVRV, social volume |
| `{type: "consecutive_differences"}` | Replace each value with the difference from the prior value | Compute daily change from a cumulative metric |
| `{type: "percent_change"}` | Replace each value with the percent change from the prior value | Normalize changes across metrics with different scales |

Transforms reduce the number of returned data points by N-1 for moving averages. Request a slightly wider time range to compensate.

## Dynamic Discovery

When you don't know the exact metric name for a user's request, follow this 3-step workflow. Always prefer dynamic discovery over hardcoded values.

### Step 1 — Fetch the metric list

```graphql
{
  getAvailableMetrics
}
```

Returns 1,000+ `snake_case` strings. **The response is large** — save to a file, don't pipe through stdin:

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://api.santiment.net/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Apikey <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
  -d '{"query": "{ getAvailableMetrics }"}' \
  -o /tmp/santiment-metrics.json
```

Filter by plan with `getAvailableMetrics(product: SANAPI, plan: BUSINESS_PRO)`.

### Step 2 — Search by keywords

Search the saved file for keywords matching user intent. Example: whale activity → search for `holder`, `top`, `whale`, `supply`, `amount_in`. See `references/metrics-catalog.md` for intent-to-keyword mappings.

### Step 3 — Inspect metadata before querying

Once you have candidate metrics, fetch metadata to confirm compatibility:

```graphql
{
  getMetric(metric: "amount_in_top_holders") {
    metadata {
      availableSlugs
      availableAggregations
      availableSelectors
      dataType
      defaultAggregation
      minInterval
    }
  }
}
```

This reveals required selectors (e.g., `holdersCount`), supported slugs, and minimum interval. Requesting a smaller interval than `minInterval` returns an error. See `examples/query-patterns.md` example 5 for a worked example.

### Find a project's slug

Look up a specific project by slug to verify it exists and see its details:

```graphql
{
  projectBySlug(slug: "bitcoin") {
    slug
    name
    ticker
    infrastructure
  }
}
```

Browse all projects paginated (useful when the user provides a token name or ticker instead of a slug):

```graphql
{
  allProjects(page: 1, pageSize: 50) {
    slug
    name
    ticker
  }
}
```

### Check data availability for a metric and slug

Before making a large timeseries query, verify that data exists for the desired metric-slug combination and check freshness:

```graphql
{
  getMetric(metric: "daily_active_addresses") {
    availableSince(slug: "ethereum")
    lastDatetimeComputedAt(slug: "ethereum")
  }
}
```

### Check access restrictions for your plan

Understand what historical range your API key can access for each metric. Call this to avoid wasted queries that would return restriction errors:

```graphql
{
  getAccessRestrictions(product: SANAPI, plan: BUSINESS_PRO, filter: METRIC) {
    name
    isAccessible
    isRestricted
    restrictedFrom
    restrictedTo
    minInterval
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

The Santiment API always returns HTTP **200**, even when there are application-level errors. Never rely on HTTP status codes alone — always parse the response JSON and check for the `errors` array.

A typical error response:

```json
{
  "data": { "getMetric": null },
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "The metric 'nonexistent_metric' is not a valid metric.",
      "locations": [{ "line": 2, "column": 3 }]
    }
  ]
}
```

When the `data` field contains `null` and the `errors` array is present, the query failed. The `message` field describes the problem. Common errors and how to resolve them:

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Invalid metric name | Metric string doesn't exist | Verify with `getAvailableMetrics` |
| Invalid slug | Asset slug not recognized | Verify with `allProjects` or `projectBySlug` |
| Interval too small | Requested interval below minimum for this metric or plan | Check `metadata { minInterval }` |
| Time range restricted | Historical range exceeds plan allowance | Check `getAccessRestrictions` |
| Complexity too high | Query requests too many data points | Reduce time range, increase interval, or fetch fewer fields |
| HTTP 429 | Rate limit exceeded | Back off exponentially and retry after a delay |

The one exception to the HTTP 200 rule is rate limiting: HTTP **429** means the account's quota is exhausted. See `references/rate-limits.md` for tier details and optimization strategies.

## Quick Reference: Building a Query

Follow these steps to construct any Santiment API query:

1. **Pick a metric** — use directly if known, otherwise follow the Discovery Workflow above.
2. **Pick a slug** — e.g., `"bitcoin"`. Resolve names/tickers via `projectBySlug` or `allProjects`.
3. **Pick a time range** — `from`/`to` with relative expressions (preferred) or ISO 8601. Check `availableSince` first.
4. **Pick an interval** — `"1d"`, `"1h"`, `"7d"`. Larger intervals reduce complexity.
5. **Pick a sub-field** — `timeseriesData` for series, `aggregatedTimeseriesData` for a single value, `timeseriesDataPerSlugJson` for multi-asset.
6. **Optionally add** — `transform`, `selector` (instead of `slug`), or `aggregation` override.

After constructing the query, execute it via curl with the user's API key and parse the JSON response. Always check for the `errors` array before processing `data`.
